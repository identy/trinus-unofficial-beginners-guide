There are plenty of active users in the Trinus community right now, so don’t be afraid to ask as many questions as possible. This document will try and get you started, but there’s always unknowns that will crop up and the following options will help you get through those.

### Getting Started Videos

I highly suggest you watch all these videos just to get your bearings before you start your build process.

> ##### NOTE
> The Printer Assembly video was created using a **Prototype** unit during the Kickstarter Campaign; before the production units were realized, so there will be some differences. Even with that said, I still feel it’s a great video to watch before assembling your printer (No Assembly Instructions? Check the [Downloads](#download-it) section).

> ##### WARNING {.warning}
> Make sure when attaching the Extruder Assembly / Laser Mount, that you **don't over tighten the screws**. This can mess with the threading of the mount point but also cause your screws to get stuck to the point of having to using a Drill / Dremel to cut the screw head for removal. To help with this process, hold the included wrench so that you are holding the shorter section, to reduce the amount of torque you can apply.
