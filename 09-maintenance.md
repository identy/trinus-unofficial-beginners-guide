## Maintenance

This is where you can find out how to make your printer last a long time and ensure it’s running smoothly.

### Axis Sliders
Here’s a video from Marius Hirn on how to take apart the Axis sliders, clean, grease, and put it all back together again. This will also be helpful if you need to remove backlash (back and forth) movement on the sliders (by tightening the spring a bit more).

### Nozzle Cleaning - Cold Pulling
Here’s a method known as Cold Pulling, where you heat up the nozzle just enough to get the filament soft, then reduce the temp so it’s a bit more firm, and pull it out. You can repeat this process until the nozzle is clean.

* Heat nozzle to 160C
* Push down the lever and manually push the filament into the nozzle so that some extruders.
* Now reduce the temperature to 90C.
* Push down the lever again and pull the filament out. This can require a bit of force to pull out, but the filament should be soft enough that you can pull it out without hurting anything.
* If there was something stuck on your hotend, it should be attached to the filament you pulled out. Just keep repeating this “heat, cool, pull” process until the nozzle comes out clean like the following image. <div>**[ INSERT IMAGE ]**</div>


> ##### Tip: Using Nylon
> Some people love to use Nylon filament for this process as it does a great job of holding on to the gunk that might be stuck in the nozzle. If you plan on doing this, you will want to heat the nozzle to 230C, then reduce to 100C for the pull.
