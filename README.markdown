# Trinus - The Unofficial Beginners Guide

This version of the Unofficial Beginners Guide is a work in progress as it's slowly being converted from the original version (Google Doc) over to a Markdown format. 

This will enable Trinus owners that would like to contribute to the guide a better option via Pull Requests.

## Compiling
The HTML file is compiled using Pandoc (http://pandoc.org/index.html), see their website on how to install it on your machine if you want to compile the current (in progress) version of the document. Then the HTML file is opened inside of Chrome and using the Print to PDF feature, is how the PDF file is created.

The latest compiled files will always be **unofficial-beginners-guide** (HTML / PDF)
