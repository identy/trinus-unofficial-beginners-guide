### Update Firmware
If you want to ensure your Trinus is up to date with the latest firmware, which may fix known issues, then here’s a quick look on how to do this process. You can get the latest version of the firmware from the Downloads section.

#### Check Firmware Version
* Connect your Trinus to your PC/Mac via USB.
* Load up Pango and open to the Pango Console, then click on the tab at the bottom. ![Pango - terminal button](chapter-08-advanced-procedures/firmware/img/pango-console-terminal-tab.png)
